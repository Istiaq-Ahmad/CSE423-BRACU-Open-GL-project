Metro Rail in Dynamic Environment 
==================================================


We will create a scenario of a metro rail during day & night with some buildings & trees in the background. According to the user's input of day/night, time (sun/moon location) & the position of metro rail will change.  


Coding Process & use of different Algorithms: 

- Buildings, Metro rail & Bridge with scaling, translation & sharing matrix with the help of quads & triangles.

- Trees & sun with Mid-Point Circle Algorithms

- Fence with Midpoint Line Algorithms

So, we used Midpoint Line Algorithms, Midpoint Circle Algorithms, Transformation & necessary different gl. functions.
